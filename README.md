## Welcome to Microsoft Imagine's Solar System Viewer Activity
Hello from the [Microsoft Imagine team](http://imagine.microsoft.com)! Thanks for checking out our **Solar System Viewer**.  Learn how to use three.js/WebGL to display a 3D simulation of our planets in your web browser!

## Microsoft Imagine?
Microsoft Imagine gives you the tools you need to experiment, explore, and launch your ideas.  Learn the basics of coding and you can create anything you dream. See where you can take code, and where coding can take you.  

## What is this?

This repository holds the assets, HTML, and JavaScript source code for this **Solar System Viewer** activity. 

If you're new to HTML, JavaScript, or just need some guidance overall, [head to the Solar System Viewer activity page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/imagine/imagine-create042) on the [Microsoft Imagine site](http://imagine.microsoft.com) and follow our steps in the embedded Office Mix to complete the code for your own version of the activity.

Otherwise, feel free to use our Solar System Viewer code and assets to start a new solar system, and develop the skills to turn your own ideas into something real.  

## How do I start?
To get started with the Solar System Viewer, you'll want to install the following:
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)

The [Solar System Viewer's Office Mix](https://msdn.microsoft.com/imagine/imagine-create042) has installation instructions if you need them.

## How do I use GitHub Desktop to get this?
Never done this before and just want the files to work with on your own? 

Click on the **Clone or download** button and you can make a copy of all of these files on your machine that you can work with.  Use **Open in Desktop** to open the repo in GitHub Desktop. Alternatively, **Download ZIP** and then unzip the files in a familiar location on your computer.

Remember where you save these files, so you can find them again in Visual Studio!
